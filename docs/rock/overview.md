## What is ROCK

ROCK (Reinforcement Open Construction Kit) is an open-source reinforcement learning environment development framework. By using ROCK, developers can quickly develop reinforcement learning environments and integrate with other reinforcement learning training frameworks to implement efficient reinforcement learning training.

ROCK provides comprehensive sandbox environment management capabilities, supports containerized deployment, and enables rapid creation, execution, and destruction of environments. Additionally, ROCK is compatible with the GEM protocol, providing standardized interfaces for reinforcement learning environments.

## Core Capabilities of ROCK

1. **Simplified Development Process**: Simplifies the development, construction, and management of reinforcement learning environments, supporting various open-source reinforcement learning environments
2. **Large-scale Scheduling and Deployment**: Enables large-scale scheduling and deployment of rapid reinforcement learning environments. By supporting the GEM protocol, reinforcement learning environments can be easily accessed
3. **Framework Integration**: Integrates with other reinforcement learning training frameworks to achieve large-scale and scalable reinforcement learning training

## Value of ROCK

ROCK provides significant value to different roles of engineers:

- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Engineers**: ROCK simplifies the development process of reinforcement learning environments, allowing engineers to focus on algorithm implementation
- **Reinforcement Learning Application Engineers**: ROCK enables large-scale deployment of rapid reinforcement learning environments, improving application development efficiency
