## SDK

### New Features
* Added the `response_limited_bytes_in_nohup` parameter to the `Sandbox.arun()` method to address request timeouts caused by excessively long responses. For details, see [Sandbox SDK Reference](../References/Python%20SDK%20References/sandbox.md).
* Added the `read_file_by_line_range` method to `Sandbox`, resolving the limitation in `Sandbox.read_file` that prevented reading files with more than 1,000 lines. Note that this method does not guarantee exact fidelity with the original file content and may lose newline characters or other information. Use with caution. For details, see [Sandbox SDK Reference](../References/Python%20SDK%20References/sandbox.md).

### Upgrades
* Optimized wheel package dependencies to reduce the likelihood of conflicts with other projects.
