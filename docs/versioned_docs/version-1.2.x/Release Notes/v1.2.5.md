### New Features

#### Custom Metrics Endpoint
- **NEW**: Support specifying a custom OTLP metrics endpoint via `metrics_endpoint` in `RuntimeConfig`. Previously the endpoint was hardcoded to `http://{host}:{port}/v1/metrics`; now it can be configured to any OTLP-compatible collector.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
runtime:
  metrics_endpoint: "http://my-otel-collector:4317/v1/metrics"
```

#### User-Defined Metric Tags
- **NEW**: Support adding custom tags to all metrics via `user_defined_tags` in `RuntimeConfig`. These tags are merged into the base attributes of every metric emitted by Admin, SandboxProxyService, and SandboxActor.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
runtime:
  user_defined_tags:
    cluster: "prod-cluster"
    region: "cn-hz"
    service: "rock-sandbox"
```

#### Metrics IP Tag
- **NEW**: Added `ip` field to metrics base attributes for better instance identification in monitoring dashboards.

#### Actor Metrics Endpoint
- **NEW**: Exposed `metrics_endpoint` configuration to `SandboxActor`, allowing Ray actors to report metrics to custom OTLP endpoints. The endpoint is propagated from `RuntimeConfig` to actors during sandbox creation.

### Enhancements

#### Nacos Configuration
- **NEW**: Added `server_addresses` field to `NacosConfig`, enabling direct connection to Nacos servers (e.g., Aliyun MSE) without relying solely on the `endpoint` parameter.

**Configuration Example:**
```yaml
nacos:
  server_addresses: "mse-xxx.nacos.mse.aliyuncs.com:8848"
  group: "DEFAULT_GROUP"
  data_id: "rock-config"
```
